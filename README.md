Open XML SDK
============

All of these come from npm:

 * [DocumentFormat.OpenXml](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK) -Version 2.11.3
 * [OpenXmlPowerTools](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools) -Version 4.5.3.2

The only differences are to the .csproj files, which have been redone to support .NET Core 3.1

Licensing and change logs are part of the original distribution.
